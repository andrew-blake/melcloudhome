# direnv configuration for ~/Development
# This file applies to all subdirectories unless overridden by a local .envrc

# Load .env file if it exists (for secrets and API keys)
# Add .env to .gitignore to keep secrets out of version control
dotenv_if_exists .env

# Example: Load environment-specific .env files
# dotenv_if_exists .env.local
# dotenv_if_exists .env.development

# Example: Set common environment variables
# export DEVELOPMENT_ROOT=$(pwd)
# export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Example: Add common tools to PATH
# PATH_add bin
# PATH_add scripts

# Subdirectories can have their own .envrc that extends or overrides these settings
# When you cd into a subdirectory with its own .envrc, both will be loaded (parent first, then child)
